# TS Notes

Welcome to my TS Notes repository. This repository has been created as a review, and its purpose is to provide code samples and notes.

## Contents

In each part of the example code there are comments that explain some things that facilitate understanding and review.

## Aditional Resources

[Exercism (TypeScript)](https://exercism.org/tracks/typescript): A platform where you can learn and practice the language by solving programming problems.

Happy coding!
